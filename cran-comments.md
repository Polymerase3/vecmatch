## Minor release
In this version, I have:

* Added `borders` argument to `csregion()` to control the behavior of the function at the borders of the CSR.
* Updated `match_gps()` to handle databases with only two unique treatments.
* Added a vignette.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes in the package.
